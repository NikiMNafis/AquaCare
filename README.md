This project is my thesis project which aims to create an android-based application that functions to help aquascape hobbyists in identifying their water quality and provide suggestions based on the identification results. This application uses Firebase to manage user accounts and store identification data, implement Coroutine and MVVM design pattern, and uses Fuzzy Tsukamoto method to identify water.
